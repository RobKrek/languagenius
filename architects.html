    <li>Separately highlight the architects who worked in the style of national romanticism; </li>
    <li>One of the founders of the "national romanticism" in Riga was Konstantin Pekshens. Many architects who worked in this style were either his students (had a student internship in his architectural bureau), or worked with him. Our hypothesis is that all the architects who worked with Pekshens then worked in the style of "national romanticism" — we could try to make such a correlation;  </li>
    <li>Also in our database there is an opportunity to sort by the university where the architect studied — perhaps there will be a correlation that RTU graduates worked in the style of "national romanticism"; </li>
    <li>DIAGRAM. The amount of knowledge of an architect studied by the Museum of Art Nouveau.  </li>
