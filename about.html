                <p>The research members of the project are all students from RTU's digital humanities master study
                    program. This page was created by Languagenius team members Roberts Krēķis, Selīna Kalnišķe,
                    Svetlana Denikina, and Tong Zhou. The group members are experts with a good knowledge of Latvian
                    language, culture, and history. Everyone has their own unique perspective and knowledge, allowing
                    them to explore this mysterious and fascinating architectural style from multiple angles. They
                    believe that in such a multicultural group, they are able to learn from each other, grow together,
                    and explore in-depth all aspects of this study.</p>

            <h2>About Dataset</h2>
            <div class="textbox">
                <p>There is no ready-made database on the topic of our research, so we created it ourselves from
                    scratch. It was based on information collected by the Riga Art Nouveau Museum — <a
                        href="https://jugendstils.riga.lv/eng/">https://jugendstils.riga.lv/eng/</a></p>
                <p>The museum staff has studied a little more than 100 buildings in Riga, which are classified as Art
                    Nouveau buildings. The year of their construction and the architect have been accurately determined.
                    However, this information is presented on the museum's website in an unstructured form (texts,
                    photographs), so we had to do a lot of work to make this data structured.</p>
                <p>In addition, during the compilation of the database, we checked the data (for example, duplicates of
                    addresses with different data on the year of construction and the architect were found), the data
                    were enriched with information from other sources.</p>

                <p><strong>Microsoft Excel:</strong> The traditional application was used for data cleaning and wrangling, including data
                    cleaning, format conversion, standardization, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Voyant Tools:</strong> This tool can be used for text data analysis, including keyword
                    extraction, word cloud generation, word frequency analysis, etc. In this project, it may be
                    necessary to analyze historical texts or architectural descriptions, and using Voyant Tools can
                    assist the team in better understanding these textual data.</p>
                <p><strong>QGIS:</strong> This tool can be used to process and visualize geographic data, including
                    mapping, spatial analysis, geocoding, and more. In this project, the geographical location of
                    buildings and architects needs to be mapped and compared with historical maps and geographic data.
                    Using QGIS can assist the team to better process and display these geographic data.</p>
                <p><strong>IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook:</strong> This tool can be used to analyze and visualize complex network data,
                        including social networks, relational networks, etc. In this project, it may be necessary to analyze
                        the relationship and influence between architects, and using Gephi can assist the team to better
                        understand these network data.</p>
                <p><strong>Adobe Creative Suite:</strong> This tool can be used to design graphics, diagrams, posters,
                    or other visual elements, including software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, which can
                    help the group create professional-level visual materials.</p>
                <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> This tool can be used to collaboratively develop or manage code while
                    providing convenient features such as issue tracking, code review, and automated deployment.</p>
