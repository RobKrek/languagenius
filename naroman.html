<p>National Romanticism was a cultural and artistic movement that emerged in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a response to the increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of society and an attempt to celebrate and promote national identity and culture. National Romanticism influenced many art forms, including architecture, and its legacy can still be seen in buildings around the world. It focuses on indigenous culture, history and tradition and uses local building materials and craftsmanship, emphasising the integration of architecture and nature with a romantic sensibility and nationalism. Riga, Latvia, as one of the representatives of this architectural style, has many famous National romanticism buildings which are an important part of the Riga cityscape and one of Latvia's cultural heritage. In this part, we use the features of Voyant Tools to carry out a word cloud analysis on National Romanticism buildings. By analysing the word cloud and the textual analysis, we can better understand the characteristics and cultural context of National Romanticism buildings.</p>
